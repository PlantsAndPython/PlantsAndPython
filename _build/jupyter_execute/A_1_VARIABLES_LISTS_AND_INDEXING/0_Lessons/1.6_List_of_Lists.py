# ### Let's talk about plant evolution
# 
# - Plants are essential to human life
#     - Plants feed, clothe, shelter, medicate, and inspire us
#     - Plants regulate global cycles of water and carbon
# - Plants are diverse, more diverse than just the plants we see on land or those that flower
# - Plants are hierarchically organized, reflecting evolutionary history
# - Plants are defined by a single, ancient endosymbiotic event that created choloroplasts

# In this lesson we're going to make a listÂ of lists about plant evolution, so let'sÂ introduce the plant kingdom from aÂ broad perspective. Plants are essential toÂ human life. You have undoubtedly ate a plantÂ today. If you didn't eat a plant directly youÂ ate an animal and the only reason that animalÂ exists is because somewhere on the food chainÂ a plant was eaten. Plants clothe us, they shelterÂ us, they medicate us, they drug us, they inspire us.Â Plants also regulate global cycles of water. TheyÂ are drawing water up through the soil usingÂ their roots and then through capillary action andÂ evaporation, something called transpiration atÂ their leaves, they're constantly pullingÂ up water and releasing it into the air.Â They're also assimilating carbon, through carbon dioxide, into sugars, and on longer periodsÂ of time they're taking carbon and storing it inÂ the ground through roots or on geologic scalesÂ the plants are dying and storing carbon in theÂ ground that way.
# 
# Plants are diverse. They'reÂ even more diverse, as you'll see in a second, thanÂ just the plants we see on the land or even thoseÂ that flower and they're hierarchically organizedÂ and this reflects their evolutionary history.Â Â 
# 
# And plants are a singleÂ group. They are defined by a single, ancientÂ endosymbiotic event that created chloroplasts whenÂ a eukaryotic cell engulfed a cyanobacteria.
# 
# _____
# 
# To give you an idea of what the diversity ofÂ true plants look like, remember plants are definedÂ by an ancient event where a eukaryotic cell withÂ a nucleus engulfed a photosynthetic bacteriumÂ called a cyanobacteria. Some of the groups ofÂ plants that resulted from this, through evolution,Â were the Rhodophytes, the red algae. Some of the greenÂ algae, which mostly live in marine environments,Â are giant single-celled organisms,Â including *Acetabularia* with one single nucleus or *Caulerpa* with many nuclei in a giant, macroscopic cell. There are Bryophytes,Â the mosses, the liverworts,Â which have flattened structures that make beautiful branching patterns, and hereÂ are the Pteridophytes, the ferns.Â This is a panel of gymnosperms and pinecones, andÂ then we have some beautiful flowers, monocots,Â and these are a specific group of dicots,Â the Nepenthes. These panels are from Ernst Haeckel'sÂ *Art forms of Nature*, just to give you an idea ofÂ some of the forms of plants that are out there.

# ![Haeckel.jpg](../../images/Haeckel.jpg)

# AllÂ these forms arise through evolution. There'sÂ a naming scheme for plants as you'll seeÂ that's hierarchicalÂ and arises from this tree arrangement ofÂ the plants, which results from evolution. The way you should think of evolution is thatÂ there are common ancestors, and from these commonÂ ancestors that likely don't exist anymore,Â but theoretically once did, arose multiple populations. These populations are changingÂ over time.
# 
# Here, you can see we have theÂ Chlorophytes and Chara. Most of the green algae are marine, not all, but Chara is aÂ freshwater green algae. Then we go on to land andÂ we get the mosses, we get the liverworts, and the hornworts. The dominant life stage of the Bryophytes isÂ the gametophyte. This is a haploid stage of life,Â meaning it only has one copy of the genome. WeÂ go further and we get to lycophytes and ferns.Â This is where a dominant sporophyte, which isÂ diploid, arises. You can also see that theyÂ evolved flattened photosyntheticÂ structures that look a lot like leaves except thatÂ they were independently evolved from leaves, soÂ they're not technically leaves. This is a lot likeÂ a bat wing and a bird wing which are independentlyÂ evolved structures but appear and serve similarÂ purposes. We go farther and we have the evolutionÂ of seeds. TheÂ origin of the name gymnosperms is nakedÂ seed. These include pines. Eventually weÂ get to the angiosperms, the flowering plants,Â where the seed becomes enclosed in an ovaryÂ and there are flowers.
# 
# This figure was madeÂ by Dr. Eugene Plavskin and it shows where in plantÂ evolution all these novel features arose and theÂ relationship of these plant groups that we'll beÂ talking about today.

# Creating a list of listsÂ is really easy. Remember you can populate a listÂ with any data type or a mixture of data typesÂ in Python. We already saw how to populateÂ a list. You can just createÂ a list and put in a bunch of strings andÂ other lists separated by commas.
# 
# For example, we just talked aboutÂ all the plants, they have a name, the plantae,Â and then we have all these sub-groups. I didn'tÂ talk about the Glaucophytes. These are onlyÂ a few species that are aquatic. But we also have theÂ red algae, the Rhodophytes; the green algae, the Chlorophytes; the freshwaterÂ green algae, the Charophytes; and we have the mosses, the Bryophytes; the ferns,Â the Pteridophytes; the pines and other naked seed plants, the gymnosperms;Â and we have the flowering plants, the angiosperms.Â 
# 
# Notice that with the quotation marks these areÂ all strings, but angiosperms is a list.Â It has four things in it: "Vitis", "Agave_tequilana", "Hordeum_vulgare", "Oryza".
# 
# So, let's create ourÂ list `plantae`, but it's a mixture of these stringsÂ and this other list. 

# In[3]:


# Creating a list of lists is easy
# You can populate a list with any data type
# or a mixture of data types in Python!
# That means you can make a list with both
# strings and lists, for example

# As an example, let's make a list called plantae
# of all the different plants we just learned about

plantae = ["glaucophytes", "rhodophytes","chlorophytes","charaophytes",
           "bryophytes","pteridophytes","gymnosperms",angiosperms]


# Some of the the elementsÂ are just strings but `angiosperms` is a list. If we print out one of the strings, let's sayÂ position index one (which remember is the secondÂ list element), we get the Rhodophytes, but in index position 7 (which is the eighth list element) weÂ get back a list: "Vitis", "Agave_tequilana",Â "Hordeum_vulgare", and "Oryza", which is the list `angiosperms`.

# In[4]:


# Some of the elements are just strings
# but angiosperms is a list

print(plantae[1])
print(plantae[7])


# If you have a list within a list, you canÂ actually access a specific element within the listÂ 
# of the list. The way you do that is with a doubleÂ bracket notation. The the first bracketÂ 
# is going to be the index number of the list.Â So within plantae we have `angiosperms` at index position 7. ButÂ then the second double bracket is going toÂ be the second element ofÂ that list. So we have the `angiosperms` list and then withÂ index one we're getting back the second element of the list,Â which is `Agave_tequilana`. So even if you have aÂ list within lists, you can use double bracketsÂ to use indexing to try to access specificÂ elements.

# In[5]:


# You can access an element within a list of a list
# by first indexing the parent list and then
# the index within that list of the element.
# Double brackets are used to do this

# If we want to access "Agave_tequilana" in our plantae list...

plantae[7][1]


# Like *Vitis*, which *Vitis vinifera* isÂ used famously for wine but you can use other *Vitis*Â species for other aspects of the wine making process (like rootstocks), many *Agave* types, other thanÂ *A. tequilana*, are used for other things like fiber orÂ food and maybe we need to not be so specific and change "Agave_tequilana" to "Agave". You can doÂ this just like we did before but using theÂ double brackets. So we first index out the `angiosperms` list in the overall list of `plantae`Â and then we index "Agave_tequilana", and we set itÂ equal to "Agave". Now if we print out `plantae` you seeÂ we no longer have "Agave_tequilana" but only "Agave". You can reassign elements of the listÂ using indexing just like we did in a simple list.Â 

# In[6]:


# Like Vitis, many agave types are used for purposes
# from fiber to food, and maybe we just want to change
# "Agave_tequilana" to "Agave"
# We can use double bracket indexing to reassing
# the list element

plantae[7][1] = "Agave"

print(plantae)


# Let's add some more lists by modification.Â Let's be more specific. We'll create a list calledÂ `gymnosperms`. Some gymnosperm types are conifers,Â cycads, and a really interesting group of plantsÂ called Gnetophytes. Some of the bryophytes areÂ called mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. SoÂ let's press shift + enter and create those two newÂ lists.

# In[7]:


# Let's add two more lists to our list of plantae
# Let's add some bryophytes and gymnosperms
# First, create two new lists

gymnosperms = ["conifers", "cycads", "gnetophytes"]

bryophytes = ["mosses", "liverworts", "hornworts"]


# Then we want to replace what are justÂ strings at the moment with lists. We shouldÂ see where those strings we want to replace are in the list first. At the moment we haveÂ strings called bryophytes and gymnosperms, but they are not lists. We need to replaceÂ them with our new lists. So let's figure out where they are.
# 
# They're inÂ index positions four and six.

# In[8]:


# Then, add the lists to the list of lists plantae
# First, where should we insert the lists?

print(plantae)


# Within the list `plantae`, in positionÂ six we put in the gymnosperm list and withinÂ position four we put in the bryophytes list.Â Â 
# 
# Notice that these are not strings. They don't haveÂ quotations and we defined them before as listsÂ already.
# 
# So if we print out our new `plantae` list,Â what we get now is instead of having bryophytes asÂ a string we have a list and instead of havingÂ gymnosperms as a string now we have a list as well.Â Â 

# In[9]:


# Then, insert the lists using indexing!

plantae[6] = gymnosperms
plantae[4] = bryophytes

print(plantae)


# Even though this is a list of lists, it isÂ just a list because a list is just a bunch of dataÂ types that we throw together. If we look at theÂ data type of `plantae` we see that indeed it is a list.Â Â 

# In[10]:


# Even though a list of lists, plantae is still a list
# Let's check with the type() function

type(plantae)
