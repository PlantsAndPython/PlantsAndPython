# # 1.2 Indexing

# ## What is indexing?
# - Indexing is a way for us to keep track of and to access characters in a string or elements of a list
# - Indexing takes the form of `[start:end]`
# - The first element is always zero
# - The start is inclusive
# - The end is not inclusive

# > ğŸ’¡ ***Remember:*** In the previous notebooks you created variables called `genus` and `species`. Create the variables again in the cell below to complete this lesson.

# In[2]:


# Create the variable genus
# and the variable species

genus = "Vitis"
species = "_vinifera"


# So that's how you create a variable. That's yourÂ first introduction to your first data typeÂ in Python: a string, a collection of characters.
# 
# Let's learn a little bit about indexing. IndexingÂ is a way for us to keep track of and to accessÂ characters in a string or the elements of aÂ list, which we're going to learn about soon.Â Indexing takes the form of square brackets andÂ it has a start value and an end value separated byÂ a colon. The first element in a series in PythonÂ is always zero. It's not one. It starts at zero.Â A start value of indexing is inclusive. It is theÂ number itself, but importantly the end value is notÂ inclusive. The indexing goes up to the end value butÂ does not include it.
# 
# So let's remember: we hadÂ our variable genus. Remember that we assignedÂ it the value the string of `"Vitis"`. Let's try toÂ access the first letter of that string, the "V".Â Your first intuition might be that to getÂ to the first element you would say "1". So we takeÂ our variable genus, we put in the square brackets,Â and we put in a "1" hoping to get back the firstÂ character. And we get back the second characterÂ instead, the "i", not the first and so this isÂ why it's important to remember that in Python theÂ first element for indexing always starts at zero.

# In[3]:


# Remember, our genus variable is "Vitis"
# Let's try to access the first element
# You might think the first element is 1

genus[1]


# When we useÂ zero now we get back the first letter, which wasÂ a "V" and you can see how you're using this numberÂ to say which letter of the string that you wantÂ to get back.

# In[4]:


# But in Python the first element is always 0

genus[0]


# We can also access multiple elementsÂ in a string using indexing. Remember indexingÂ takes the form of square brackets. It has a start,Â a colon, and an end value. Remember the start isÂ 
# inclusive and the end is not inclusive. It goes upÂ to the value of the end but does not include it.Â So let's try to get back all the letters of "Vitis".Â Â 
# 
# There are five letters in "Vitis" and youÂ might think we need five index places and weÂ remember that the indexing starts at zero, so to have fiveÂ index places would be zero, one, two, three, four. Maybe toÂ get the whole 'Vitis" back we go from zero to four?
# 
# ButÂ that is not the case. Remember the reason isÂ because the start value is inclusive, so thisÂ will be index of 0, but this will go up to the value of 4Â but not included. The fourth element is "s". If we index using 4, it does not include "s", it just goesÂ right up to it.

# In[5]:


# We can also access multiple elements using indexing
# Indexing takes the form of [start:end]
# The start is inclusive
# The end is not inclusive
# "Vitis" has five characters
# To access the whole world, maybe we might try:

genus[0:4]


# And so to get back the wholeÂ value of "Vitis" from our variable genus we haveÂ to remember that the end is not inclusive. We'reÂ going to go up to it but not include it. SoÂ if we go from 0 to 5 that's 6 characters butÂ remember it doesn't include the five it justÂ goes right up to it. So if we index 0:5, we are going up to but not including the 6th position and we include all 5 characters of "Vitis".

# In[6]:


# But remember, the end is not inclusive
# We need to add one more value to include the last character

genus[0:5]


# Because characters in a string can be indexed,Â they're assigned values. You can do arithmeticÂ with strings, believe it or not. Let's create some more variables to set ourselves upÂ for the next section. Let's addÂ genus plus species together. We'reÂ going to create a new variable now called wine. If we create our new variable,Â wine, and we say it's equal to genus (which wasÂ "Vitis") plus species (which is the stringÂ "\_vinifera") we create that new variable andÂ then we can print it. Let's see what we get then: We get "Vitis_vinifera" all togetherÂ as one because we added the two strings together.

# In[7]:


# Because characters can be indexed, you can do artihmetic with strings!
# Let's create some more variables to set ourselves up for the next section
# Let's add genus + species together and call the new variable "wine"

wine = genus + species

print(wine)


# ForÂ the next section, let's create two moreÂ variables. Let's call one tequila in the sameÂ theme and it comes from the plant "Agave_tequilana".Â And we have beer and that comes from barley,Â "Hordeum_vulgare". Remember to execute this cellÂ so that we can get those variables back.

# In[8]:


# Let's also create two other variables in the same theme

tequila = "Agave_tequilana"
beer = "Hordeum_vulgare"


# So let'sÂ print out our variables to make sure that they areÂ okay and remember we can put multiple variablesÂ into our print function between the parentheses.Â They're separated by a comma. We getÂ the values back for our three variables. For wineÂ we get "Vitis_vinifera"; tequila, "Agave_tequilana",Â and beer we get "Hordeum_vulgare". Notice that we have common names forÂ all these: grapes, agave and barley but weÂ have these very scientific names in LatinÂ for these species. There's always somethingÂ called a genus, which is the first wordÂ and a second word, which is called the speciesÂ epithet, and together these formally name a species.

# In[9]:


# Let's print our variables to check that they are OK

print(wine, tequila, beer)
