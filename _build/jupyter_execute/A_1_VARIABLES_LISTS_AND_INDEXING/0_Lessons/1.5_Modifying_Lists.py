# ***The following is a transcript of the video.***

# > ğŸ’¡ ***Remember:*** In the previous notebook you created a list called `angiosperms` containing the strings `wine`, `tequila`, and `beer`. Create the list again in the cell below to complete this lesson.

# In[2]:


# Create the list angiosperms

wine = "Vitis_vinifera"
tequila = "Agave_tequilana"
beer = "Hordeum_vulgare"

angiosperms = [wine, tequila, beer]


# So how can we modifyÂ a list? List elements can just be reassignedÂ using indexing. For example, other speciesÂ than *Vitis vinifera* can be used to make wine.Â Some species we'll talk aboutÂ later in this course are used for rootstocksÂ instead, or they're hybridized withÂ *Vitis vinifera* to make different types of wine. SoÂ maybe it's not right of us to call wine just *VitisÂ vinifera* that specifically, maybe we should sayÂ that it's all *Vitis*. So let's try to turn *VitisÂ vinifera* back into just *Vitis*.
# 
# We can print outÂ the first element of our angiosperm list with zeroÂ and see what it is. It should be *Vitis vinifera*.Â We specify that we're talking about the firstÂ element of angiosperms through indexing, so we sayÂ angiosperms index zero, and we just setÂ it equal to *Vitis*. Remember it will beÂ currently set to *Vitis vinifera* but then itÂ changes into *Vitis*. Then, if we print out theÂ list again we shouldn't have *Vitis vinifera*Â we should have just *Vitis*.
# 
# You can see thatÂ the first element is *Vitis vinifera*, we reassign it,Â and then when we print the list again you can seeÂ that *Vitis vinifera* has been transformed intoÂ *Vitis*. All we did is used an equal signÂ and specified the first element with zero.

# In[3]:


# List elements can be reassigned using indexing
# Other species than Vitis vinifera can be used to make wine
# For example, some species of Vitis we will talk about
# are used as rootstocks
# Let us reassign "Vitis_vinifera" in our list to just "Vitis"

print(angiosperms[0])

angiosperms[0] = "Vitis"

print(angiosperms)


# AnotherÂ way to modify lists that we will use very often isÂ Â called the `.append()` function.
# 
# Step one for usingÂ this is to add the `.append()` after a list name.Â Â 
# 
# Step two is to add within the parentheses theÂ additional element that you would like to appendÂ to the list. The appended element will be addedÂ to the end of the list.
# 
# So using length weÂ already know that our current list angiospermsÂ has three elements.

# Another way to modify lists is using the .append() function
# Step 1 is to add ".append()" after a list name
# Step 2 is to add within the parentheses the additional element
# that you want to append to a list
# The appended element will be added to the end of the list
# Currently our list angiosperms has 3 elements

len(angiosperms)


# But let's say we wanted to addÂ rice, used to make sake, to the end of our list.
# 
# We specify the list `angiosperms` and we add `.append()`. You shouldÂ think of this as the `append()` is going to modifyÂ this list and we put in the stringÂ value that we want to add, the name for rice, whichÂ is `Oryza`. If we hit shift + enter we should beÂ adding `Oryza` to the end of our angiosperm list. 

# In[5]:


# But let's add rice, used to make sake, to the end of our list

angiosperms.append("Oryza")


# Let's print out our angiosperm list. Now you seeÂ we have four things. Oryza, rice has been added toÂ the last position. If we print out the lengthÂ of our new angiosperms list we see that it's four,Â not three. So we successfully appended this valueÂ to the end of the list.

# In[6]:


# Now, our list should have 4 elements

print(angiosperms)

print(len(angiosperms))
