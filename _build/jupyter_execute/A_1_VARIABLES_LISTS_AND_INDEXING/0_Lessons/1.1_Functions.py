# > ğŸ’¡ ***Remember:*** In the previous notebook you created a variable called `genus`. Create the variable `genus` again in the cell below to complete this lesson.

# In[2]:


# Create the variable genus

genus = "Vitis"


# You can also get the value backÂ of a variable using a function. So let's goÂ over our very first function, the simplest whichÂ is `print()`. A function in Python has a nameÂ 
# like print and it has a set of parentheses.Â You put an input inside the parentheses andÂ 
# the function processes the input to produceÂ an output. So for example, the output ofÂ 
# the `print()` function is to simply print outÂ the value of our variable. So if weÂ 
# print `genus` what we get back is `"Vitis"`.

# In[3]:


# You can use the print() function to see a variable value
# A function always has a set of parentheses
# You place the input inside the parentheses
# The function processes the input to produce an output
# The output of the print() function is to print out our variable

print(genus)


# You can use commas to separate print outputs by aÂ space and both variables and strings can be usedÂ with the print function. So for example, in ourÂ print function if we put a string in quotationÂ marks `"The variable genus is equal to"` and thenÂ we put a comma and then we put our variableÂ `genus`, if we execute the print function what weÂ get is `The variable genus is equal to Vitis`.Â Â 

# In[4]:


# Use commas to separate print() outputs by a space
# Both variables and strings can be used with print()

print("The variable genus is equal to", genus)
