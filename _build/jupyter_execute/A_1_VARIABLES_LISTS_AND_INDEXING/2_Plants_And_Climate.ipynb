    "Humanity has an intimate relationship with plants. Through photosynthesis, plants are the ultimate source of nearly all food that humans consume. Plants are the source of many medicinal products, as well as religious and recreational psychoactive substances. Plants provide fibers for clothing and structural materials for buildings. Starting around 10,000 BCE, humanity started domesticating crops. The cultivation of plant species that had been dramatically altered by humans increased available calories and fueled the growth of civilizations across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because plants are so diverse and vary in the composition of their communities across the world, the definition of \"plant\" is culturally specific, and reflects the relationship of a culture with local flora. Here, we are going to focus on a scientific definition of plants. A defining features of plants is that they are autotrophic: that is, they are capable of synthesizing their food from inorganic substances. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, using sunlight as energy. Cyanobacteria are a group of extant bacteria that perform photosynthesis. It is speculated that that long ago a cyanobacteriaum was engulfed by a single-cell eukaryote (an organism with a nucleus that contains most of its DNA). The cyanobacteria and the eukaryote developed a symbiosis, in which the engulfed cyanobacteria remained in the eukaryotic cell providing photosynthetically-derived carbohydrates. Through this endosymbiosis, the cyanobacteria evolved into a chloroplast, an organelle within plant cells where photosynthesis occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this single endosymbiotic event, all plants (and their captured cyanobacterium that provides photosynthesis in their cells as a chloroplast) arose. The descendants of the symbiotic cell are called the Archaeplastida (\"old\" + \"plastid\"). The Archaeplastida consist of three main groups: Glaucophyta (glaucophytes), Rhodophyta (red algae), and the Viridiplantae (green plants). The glaucophytes are a small group of freshwater unicellular algae of which only 15 species have been described. The red algae are mostly multicellular and marine. Over 7,000 species have been described. They possess beautiful branching architectures and a characteritic red color that arises from photosynthetic accessory pigments called phycobiliproteins, which capture light energy that is passed to chlorophyll molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third group is the Viridiplantae, or the \"green plants\". Below, the major groups of green plants are briefly described."

Unlike the land plants, the spectacular diversity of the Chlorophytes is underappreciated. There are around 4,000 species of Chlorophyta that inhabit mostly marine but also freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Macroscopic complexity arose multiple times in Chlorophyta, through multicellularity (e.g., sea lettuce, *Ulva*), multicellular colonies (*Volvox*), and giant, single-celled organisms (siphonous algae like *Caulerpa* and *Acetabularia*). Like land plants, some Chlorophytes independently made it to land, through symbiosis. Lichens are terrestrial symbiotic organisms that arise between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner. The photobiont is usually a Chloropytic algae, but can also include cyanobacteria or other algae (or combinations thereof)."

Charophytes are named after *Chara*, a multicellular alga that superficially resembles land plants, with stem- and leaf-like structures. *Choleochaete* is another multicellular alga that forms a flat disc and with many features of land plants, including retaining zygotes after fertilization and plasmodesmata (cytoplasmic connections between adjacent cells).

All plants are characterized by the \"alteration of generations\": they alternate between haploid gametophytes with only one set of chromosomes that arise from spores and produce gametes and diploid sporophytes with two sets of chromosomes that arise through the fusion of two gametes and produce spores. In bryophytes, the larger and longer-lived stage is the gametophyte (unlike other land plants, in which the sporophyte is dominant). Unlike the elaborate sporophytes of other land plants, bryophyte sporophytes are unbranched."

Pteridophytes are comprised of the Lycopodiophyta (club mosses, 1,200 species) and the Pteridophyta (ferns, whisk ferns, and horsetails, 11,000 species). Ferns have elaborate leaves called megaphylls, that are highly branched. These fronds develop acropetally (from the tip to base) and unfurl from a structure called a \"fiddlehead\". The evolutionary history of ferns is complicated and elaborate, and likely megaphylls evolved multiple times, independently of each other and the leaves of gymnosperms and angiosperms."

    "Above, you learned about the evolutionary diversity of plants. Inherently this diversity is genetic: the differences between species are encoded in DNA. But the environment also plays a role in determining what plants are. The effects of the environment can be longterm, acting over geologic time periods as selection pressures that drive evolution. Or, the effects of climate can be over smaller time scales, during the lifetime of a plant. Plasticity refers to the effects of the environment in changing an organism's phenotype, what it is. Plants are often highly responsive to their environment: the quantity and quality of light they receive, competition with other plants or responding to animal predators, and temperature.\n",
