# **Image description:** first panel shows Fitoman holding up a peace sign with eyes closed and cap backwards and "Hola!" written behind him. He is saying "I'm Fitoman, a mexican superhero who knows everything about plants!". The second panel shows Clustalya waving saying "And I'm Clustalya, a US superhero whose mutiple mind powers allowed me to master bioinformatics!". The third panel shows Fitoman kneeling, his hand to the ground and a giant plant growing behind him, and Clustalya standing beside him in a lab coat with a giant serpent slithering around her. Next to them are rocky worlds floating in space labelled as "Modeling and Morphology", "Bioinformatics", and "Plant Science". The text says "So...let our adventure begin!"
