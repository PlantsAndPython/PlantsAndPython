    "**Image description:** first panel shows Fitoman holding up a peace sign with eyes closed and cap backwards and \"Hola!\" written behind him. He is saying \"I'm Fitoman, a mexican superhero who knows everything about plants!\". The second panel shows Clustalya waving saying \"And I'm Clustalya, a US superhero whose mutiple mind powers allowed me to master bioinformatics!\". The third panel shows Fitoman kneeling, his hand to the ground and a giant plant growing behind him, and Clustalya standing beside him in a lab coat with a giant serpent slithering around her. Next to them are rocky worlds floating in space labelled as \"Modeling and Morphology\", \"Bioinformatics\", and \"Plant Science\". The text says \"So...let our adventure begin!\""
