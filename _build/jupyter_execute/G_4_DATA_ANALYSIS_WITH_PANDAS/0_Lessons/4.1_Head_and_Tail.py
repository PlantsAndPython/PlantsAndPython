# > ğŸ’¡ ***Remember:*** Import `pandas` and read in the dataset below to complete this lesson.

# In[2]:


# Import pandas

import pandas as pd


# In[3]:


# Download the dataset from the
# Jupyter Book to read in locally or 
# read in from GitHub, below:

data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanChitwood/PlantsAndPython/master/co2_mlo_weekly.csv')


# Now let's see howÂ to look at our dataframe using head and tail.
# 
# So it's important to know what you're workingÂ with, to "see" the dataframe. Head and tailÂ allow us to do that. Remember that the dataÂ is stored in the variable `data`. We use `.head()`Â to see a preview of the firstÂ five rows and we'll also get the column names.

# In[4]:


# It's important to know what you are working with
# to "see" the dataframe
# .head() shows the first rows and column names

data.head()


# We can also use tail. And tail, if the headÂ is at the beginning, then the tail is the end. You can see that we get the last rows inÂ our dataset. Tail is very useful to see justÂ how many rows that you have overall. RememberÂ that we're beginning with zero, so we have 714Â rows or data points in this dataset.Â 

# In[5]:


# .tail() shows the las rows

data.tail()


# Describe is a very useful function thatÂ gives you back summary statistics for yourÂ continuous variables. If we use describeÂ on our data we get back information for running date,Â which is just a number that is increasing to keep trackÂ of day; year is included as a continuousÂ variable, even though we do not want it to be aÂ 
# continuous variable; and CO2 parts per million,Â which is of course a continuous variable as well. We get back howÂ many entries of each variable that we have. We have 714 of each.Â We get the mean of each; the standard deviation;Â the minimum; the quartiles at the 25th,Â 50th, and 75th percentiles; and the maximum value as well. 

# In[6]:


# .describe() is very useful, showing summary statistics
# it provides stats for continuous variables

data.describe() 


# So that's how to read in a dataframe,Â how to quickly look at the dataframe and getÂ summary statistics of the continuous variables.Â
