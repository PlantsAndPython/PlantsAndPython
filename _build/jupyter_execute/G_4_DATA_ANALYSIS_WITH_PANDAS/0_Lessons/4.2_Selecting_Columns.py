data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanChitwood/PlantsAndPython/master/co2_mlo_weekly.csv')


# Let's learn how to select specific columns of theÂ data frame.
# 
# 
# If you remember in the previousÂ example, that year was treated as a continuousÂ variable. The data that you read in has the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. But we don'tÂ want those to be treated as numbers, we want themÂ to be treated as a categorical variable, as ifÂ they were year "A", year "B", or year "C".Â Â 
# 
# So let's try to change our year columnÂ into a categorical variable. But to do thatÂ we need to know how to refer to specific columnsÂ in pandas, and this is extremely easy. This is oneÂ of the the great things of using a dataframe isÂ that you can simply refer to the columns by name,Â rather than by an index number. 
# 
# 
# If we want theÂ year column, all we do is for our dataframe data,Â we have square brackets and we just refer to yearÂ as a string in quotations. If we want to set yearÂ to a categorical variable, we use theÂ `astype()` function to convert it into a string,Â which makes it a categorical variable. So we sayÂ for the year column, referring to it as a string,Â we want to convert it `astype()` into string, andÂ we set the year column back using a string referringÂ to itself.

# In[4]:


# In the previous example 'year' was continuous
# but we want year to be categorical

# How do we refer to a specific column?

# Simply use the name of the column in brackets, as a string!

# After getting the 'year' column, simply use .astype() to change to string

data['year'] = data['year'].astype(str)


# So let's check that we were successful. You can see now when we use describe that weÂ no longer see year here, because you can't take a meanÂ or a minimum or a max of a categorical variable. We only have running dates and CO2 parts per aÂ million now. This was to show you that you canÂ access a specific column simply by referring to itÂ as a string in square brackets for a data frame inÂ pandas.

# Let's check with .describe() now if 'year' is categorical

data.describe()
