    "* **'year'**: the year the data was collected\n",
    "* **'region'**: the region in Europe that the data was collected from\n",
    "* **'harvest'**: the harvest date recorded. Harvest date is defined as number of days after August 31st. A negative number means the grapes were harvested before August 31st that year, and a positive number after.\n",
    "* **'anomaly'**: the temperature anomaly. For a given year, this number represents how much colder (negative) or hotter (positive) Europe was compared to a long term reference value, in degrees Celsius\n",
