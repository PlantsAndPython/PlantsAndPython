    "Some commands give an output that is printed on the command line screen by default. We can redirect that output to a file with the `>` character. The syntax is `command > file_name`. If the file doesn't exist it will be created. But if the file already exists **it will be overwritten**, so you have to be careful and make sure you don't overwrite a file by mistake. \n",
