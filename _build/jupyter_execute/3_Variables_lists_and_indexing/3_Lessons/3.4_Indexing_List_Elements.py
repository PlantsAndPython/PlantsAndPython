# ***The following is a transcript of the video.***

# > ğŸ’¡ ***Remember:*** In the previous notebook you created a list called `angiosperms` containing the strings `wine`, `tequila`, and `beer`. Create the list again in the cell below to complete this lesson.

# In[2]:


# Create the list angiosperms

wine = "Vitis_vinifera"
tequila = "Agave_tequilana"
beer = "Hordeum_vulgare"

angiosperms = [wine, tequila, beer]


# We can use indexing to access specificÂ list elements, just like you saw how you couldÂ access characters within a string, and it'sÂ done the exact same way.
# 
# If we have ourÂ list `angiosperms`, we can print it out but we canÂ also index it. We can index and see what the firstÂ element is, the 0 index position. We can seeÂ what the third element is, which is the second index position. Or we can try to seeÂ what the entire list is. Remember, there'sÂ three elements which normally would be zero toÂ two but we need to go up to three, because we'll goÂ up to three but not include it.
# 
# So if we look atÂ the whole list we have our three elements there.Â With zero index we fish out just the first element.Â With an index of two that ends up being theÂ third element. And then we can retrieve the entire listÂ by specifying four index positions,Â because the last position three it will go up toÂ there but not include it.

print(angiosperms)

print(angiosperms[0])

print(angiosperms[2])
