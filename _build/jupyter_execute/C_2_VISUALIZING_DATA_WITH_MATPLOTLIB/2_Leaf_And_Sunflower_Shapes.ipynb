    "Lists store data, and more often than not, data is encoded numerically. Lists are a powerful tool in Python to store and manipulate data. But before analyzing data, we must know what it is, and to know our data, we need to visualize it. When we see something we first notice its form: its shape, outline, structure, and geometry. All data has a shape, and all shapes are data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will learn to visualize our data using Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a module. Modules in Python are collections of functions and statements. Modules are usually designed to address a specific functionality or a niche community interest. The modules we will encounter in this course are generalist, and include matplotlib, pandas, and math.\n",

    "We learned in the previous lesson that plant species are diverse and numerous, occupying the oceans, rivers, and land as single-celled organisms, large and elaborate multicellular organisms, symbionts, and even colonies. Let's visualize some of this natural variation, using grapevine again as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wine we drink is made primarily from the berries of *Vitis vinifera*. But the vines themselves are chimeras: that is, most grapevines used for wine production are a surgical combination of two different species produced through grafting. The shoots may be *V. vinifera*, but the roots are wild relatives that are disease resistant and well-adapted for particular soil types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapes of grapevine leaves easily lend themselves to quantitative analysis. Every grapevine leaf has five major lobes: the leaf tip, two distal and two proximal lobes (proximal is near the leaf base and distal towards the tip). Additionally, there are distal and proximal sinuses (the indentations between the lobes). Some leaves are highly dissected (meaning they are very lobed) and others more entire (lacking lobing). Because these points are on every grapevine leaf, there is a correspondence between points, which allows us to compare the shapes of grapevine leaves against each other.\n",

Alternatively, create a variable at the beginning of your code for a parameter (like scatterplot point size) and set this attribute to the parameter value.
