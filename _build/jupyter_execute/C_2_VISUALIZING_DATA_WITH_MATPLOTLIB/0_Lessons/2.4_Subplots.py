# And finally let's talk aboutÂ subplots. What if we wanted to create one plotÂ but it had multiple panels, multiple plotsÂ within that plot, and this is where subplotsÂ comes into play. 
# 
# I will not lie, the code forÂ subplots is a little complicated. I myselfÂ often just go and look it up each time thatÂ I want to use it and you should do the same.Â I will put it in the notebooks whenever you needÂ to use it in the class but this is the generalÂ outline of what a subplot looks like. Let'sÂ go over it so we know how to use it when weÂ need it.
# 
# An alternative way to create a plotÂ in matplotlib is to actually create a variableÂ that is your figure. You can use a functionÂ called `plt.figure()` and assign it to a variable.Â Usually we call it `fig` where you store all the elements of your figure. You can put otherÂ attributes into this. For example `figsize`. ThisÂ is saying to create a 10 inch by 10 inch figure,Â using this argument when we create theÂ figure itself.
# 
# Once you have your figure,Â then you use the dot subplots function to createÂ what we call an array. What we're doingÂ here is we're modifying the figure that we justÂ created using this function subplots. The mostÂ important thing to know about the subplots is thatÂ you need to specify how many subplots you want. In this case let's create a two by two subplot. Always rows are first followed by columns. SoÂ this is a 2x2 subplot. Remember: rows followed byÂ columns. This is creating another variable andÂ it's called an array. You learned about indexing before,Â how if you have a list for example there's aÂ start and end and every element in that listÂ has a number and index associated with it. An arrayÂ is a two-dimensional indexing scheme. Remember we were specifying two rows and twoÂ columns and that's basically what this variableÂ is, an array.
# 
# Once we have these two lines ofÂ code we have created our subplots and we can getÂ to business creating our subplot. You can modifyÂ the figure directly. This is called "superiorÂ title", the title on the top for the overallÂ figure, because it's modifying the figure directly.Â We're going to call our overall figure title "TheÂ shape of grapevine leaves". We can give it a fontÂ size and modify it like we want.
# 
# But to create theÂ subplots, this is where all the magic happens. Previously, youÂ created this array and remember this is twoÂ dimensional indexing. The first value separated by the comma in the square brackets is the rows. Because we have only two rows, it's either the top or the bottom row, 0Â or 1. The second value is going to refer to theÂ columns going from left to right. It's eitherÂ the first column, 0, or it's the second one, 1. So we can refer any of the subplots: we haveÂ four of them. The oneÂ in the upper left corner is 0, 0; theÂ one in the upper right corner is 0, 1; the oneÂ in the lower left corner as 1, 0; and the oneÂ in the lower right corner as 1, 1. When youÂ index two dimensionally, indexing the arrayÂ object like this, by 0, 0 for example,Â the functions that you use, `.plot()`, `.fill()`,Â `.scatter()`, these will all modify just thisÂ one subplot. You can set a title even for justÂ this one subplot. You can modify its aspect ratio,Â turn the axis off, and on, etc.
# 
# For example, this isÂ the plot that we will create in theÂ upper left hand corner of our subplot.Â And you just go about creating the plot thatÂ you would like for the upper right hand corner,Â the lower left hand corner, and the lower rightÂ hand corner. You can see that this is a lot ofÂ code and we did a lot of things here. We created aÂ figure object, then we modified the figure objectÂ with subplots to create an array. This arrayÂ allows us through two-dimensional indexing toÂ refer to each of the plots that we want to create.
# 
# This is a lot but you can always look up theÂ skeleton of how to make a subplots online and justÂ copy and paste it from when you've used it beforeÂ or even from this notebook. So let's execute theÂ cell and this is what our subplot looks like. We createdÂ the overall figure, we can create a title for theÂ overall figure, "The shapes of grapevine leaves".Â But because we created this array with twoÂ rows and two columns, whenÂ we refer to an index in that array object,Â we can modify each of these plots as we wouldÂ like independently of each other. This creates a single, overall plot withÂ subplots and this is how we can control andÂ create different plots within an overall plot.Â Â

# **Python learning objectives**
# 
# - Lists can store numerical data that can be plotted
# - How to load in modules, sets of functionalities that allow us to do tasks in Python
# - How to create plots, scatter plots, filled polygons
# - How to manipulate shape, size, and color in plots
# - How to plot data on top of each other and use a legend
# - How to create subplots

# **Plant learning objectives**
# 
# - Phenotype is what a plant is
# - Phenotype can be measured
# - Genetic differences between closely related species results in variation
# - Morphology is one aspect of phenotype that can be measured using geometry

# # Thank you!
