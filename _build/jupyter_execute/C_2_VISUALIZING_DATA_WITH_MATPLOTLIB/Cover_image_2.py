# **Image description:** Clustalya is holding a pipette tip as a magic wand. At the end of the magic wand is a plotted grapevine leaf with the text "*Vitis palmata*" beneath it. Around Clustalya is swirling numbers and the text "*expecto patronum*". Clustalya says "The most powerful spell against data misinterpretation is plotting!"
