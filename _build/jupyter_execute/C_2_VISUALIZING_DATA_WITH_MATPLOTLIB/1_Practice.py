# # Practice with Visualizing Data using Matplotlib
# ______

# You have just learned how to import and use `matplotlib` to create plots and choose from an array of options to create aesthetically pleasing data visualizations. You have data, loaded into this notebook, that you can make plots from!
# 
# **Do this:**
# 
# In the cell below, pick a leaf from one of the species you have data for and create a plot. ***Explore and be creative!***. Based on what you learned in the video try out for yourself the different parameters. Think of what you want your visualization to look like, and if you don't know how to do something, try googling to see if you can find an answer.
# 
# You can save your plots using the `plt.savefig( )` function. Simply add the function to the end of the code for your plot and provide a filename as a string, for example `plt.savefig("myfile.jpg")`. You can use the file extensions of `.png`, `.pdf`, `.svg`, `.eps`, or `.jpg`. By default the file will be saved to your home directory, but you can change the path where the file will be saved on your computer, for example using `"./Desktop/myfile.jpg"`.
# 
# Remember, you need to import `matplotlib` first!
# 
# Have fun with your visualization!

# > ðŸ’¡ ***Remember:*** You must first import `matplotlib` in order to make plots. Below are the data that we will be working with in this lesson that are used in the video. These are lists of `x` and `y` coordinate values for 15 different *Vitis* and *Ampelopsis* species. Execute the cell below to read in the data to complete this lesson.

# In[1]:


# Execute this cell to import matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# In[2]:


# This cell contains lists of x values and y values for 
# leaf outlines of 15 Vitis and Ampelopsis species.
# Each list has the abbreviated first initial of the genus and species epithet

# Ampelopsis "acoutifolia" (actually aconitifolia)

# NOTE: There is a transcription error for this species, which is actually
# Ampelopsis aconitifolia (it is not A. "acoutifolia")
# The mistake is propagated in the videos, narration, text, and notebooks
# but it does not affect the lesson at hand for plotting in matplotlib
