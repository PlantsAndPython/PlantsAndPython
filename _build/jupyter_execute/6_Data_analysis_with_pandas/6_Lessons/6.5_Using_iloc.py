# Next,Â let's look at another way to find specific dataÂ and this is called the `iloc` function. And thisÂ is going to use rows and columns to find the dataÂ that you want. It's kind of like excel, thinkingÂ of which rows, which columns, that you want toÂ isolate the data from. And you can, for both theÂ rows and the columns, use indexing withÂ the start end colon notation that you learnedÂ about before.
# 
# So let's just review again whatÂ our data looks like. Remember we use `head` for that, it brings back the first five rows,Â but most importantly it gives you the columnÂ names. And we can see that the first column isÂ date, the second column is a running date, theÂ third column is a month, the fourth is the year,Â and the fifth is CO2.

# In[4]:


# We can also access specific rows and columns
# using indexing with .iloc()

# Let's look at the data again using .head()

data.head()


# So all you need to knowÂ about `iloc` is that the first position is rows,Â the second position is columns, andÂ you can use indexing for rows andÂ columns.
# 
# If we just use `data.iloc` and weÂ put in one number, it's the rows slot.Â Remember, indexing starts at zero, so this shouldÂ give us back just the first row of data.
# 
# And youÂ can see this is August 13th 2017, running date 1,Â august, year 2017, and parts per million 405.2,Â which is the first row of data. So rows andÂ then the index give us the first row of data.Â Â 

# In[5]:


# The first position in .iloc is rows
# The second position in .iloc is columns
# We use indexing and a colon start:end
# to reference which rows and columns we want

# Indexing starts at 0, so we get back the first row

data.iloc[0]


# Remember, negative one in indexing is a way to getÂ the last element and so if we do just negative one and again, the row position, we get back the last row.Â And you can see it's the last row because it hasÂ the running date of 714.

# In[6]:


# -1 with indexing is the last element
# it returns the last row

data.iloc[-1]


# We can reference bothÂ rows and columns, so we could say the last row,Â and remember, if we just put a colon, whichÂ should have the start and the end but we don'tÂ put any numbers we're just going to get backÂ all the values, so this will be the last rowÂ but all the columns. AndÂ indeed that's what we get:Â last row, 714, but all the columns, whichÂ is equivalent to just putting negative 1.Â But it also works this way because this isÂ formally saying we want all the columns.Â Â 

# In[7]:


# We can reference the last row and all columns

data.iloc[-1, :] # start:end, but : refers to all columns


# In this case, with just an empty colon forÂ rows, we're saying we want all the rows,Â but we just want the first column, the zero indexÂ column (remember that's date). So we get all theÂ dates because we ask for all rows of just the theÂ first column.

# In[8]:


# Here : refers to all rows
# for the first column referred to with 0

data.iloc[:,0]


# We could also get all the rows forÂ the second column, remember the second columnÂ is the running date, so that's one through 714.

# In[9]:


# We could also get all rows and the second column, at index 1

data.iloc[:,1]


# Remember, you can use indexing forÂ both the rows or the columns. The indexing isÂ inclusive of the start but up to and not includingÂ the end. So in this case we're saying we wantÂ rows two and three because we're going up to butÂ not including four, so this is rows two and threeÂ for columns from two to the end, which would beÂ the third column to the end. 
# 
# You can see weÂ get rows two and three inclusive of start up tooÂ and not including four, rows two and three, and weÂ get the second index position of columns, which isÂ the third column to the end. 

# In[10]:


# Indexing can be used for both the rows and columns

data.iloc[2:4, 2:] # indexing inclusive of start but not the end


# You can use bracketsÂ separated by commas to get very specific rowsÂ in very specific columns. So what if you wantedÂ index positions 0, 3, 5, and 7 forÂ rows and column positions 0, 2, and 4?Â And then you can see that's exactly what we get:Â we get the rows indexed by those random numbersÂ and then the first, third, and fifthÂ columns, because remember indexing startsÂ at zero. 

# In[11]:


# Brackets in brackets can be used to refer to specific rows and columns

data.iloc[[0,3,5,7],[0,2,4]]


# So `iloc` is a way to getÂ very specific data by row or by column.
