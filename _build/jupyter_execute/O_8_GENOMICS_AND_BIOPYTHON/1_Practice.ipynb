    "In this exercise, we will use Wtdbg2, a relatively new genome assembler that runs ~10 fold faster than the leading assemblers FALCON and CANU. This will allow us to assemble a high-quality genome in just a few minutes. Wtdbg2 is a _de novo_ sequence assembler for long noisy reads produced by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It assembles raw reads without error correction and then builds the consensus from intermediate assembly output. Wtdbg2 is able to assemble the human and even the 32Gb Axolotl genome at a speed tens of times faster than CANU and FALCON while producing contigs of comparable base accuracy.\n",

    "During assembly, wtdbg2 chops reads into 1024bp segments, merges similar segments into a vertex and connects vertices based on the segment adjacency on reads. The resulting graph is called fuzzy Bruijn graph (FBG). It is akin to De Bruijn graph but permits mismatches/gaps and keeps read paths when collapsing k-mers. The use of FBG distinguishes wtdbg2 from the majority of long-read assemblers.\n",
