# Next, using the pseudo-code below, create an animation of growing florets in a sunflower
# Pay attention to what the two loops are doing and how they function in real time
# Pay attention to indexing of lists
# Pay attention to the use of the .reverse() function
# Understand how this code creates an animation of a growing sunflower, frame-by-frame
# Put your answer below
