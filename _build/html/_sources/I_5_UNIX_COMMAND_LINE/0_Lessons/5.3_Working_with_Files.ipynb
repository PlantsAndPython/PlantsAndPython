    "Some commands give an output that is printed on the command line screen by default. We can redirect that output to a file with the `>` character. The syntax is `command > file_name`. If the file doesn't exist it will be created. But if the file already exists **it will be overwritten**, so you have to be careful and make sure you don't overwrite a file by mistake. \n",
    "Let's  try it with the command `ls` that lists the directory contents.\n",

    "```\n",
    "This time no output will be printed to the screen. We can verify it by clicking in the file `contents.txt` in the *Filetree* section and  the file will be opened  in the *Editor* section. We can see the two lines of output being saved and also a third line with the name of the file.\n",
