    "CS50 Sandbox [https://sandbox.cs50.io/](https://sandbox.cs50.io/) is a platform were you will be able to create and share virtual terminals. This platform is very useful for learning to work with the command line. You can go directly to the CS50 sandbox and just click on **create** to get a new terminal or go to a specific terminal that has already been created for you to work in. If you create a new terminal the changes that you make will be there the next time you enter that terminal. If you enter to a terminal that has been created by another person, the changes that you make will be eliminated and won't be there the next time you enter to that terminal.\n",

    "So, first create a new terminal on the [CS50 sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/) or go to an already created [Virtual Terminal](https://bit.ly/3d9BRCG)\n",

    "This platform has three sections. It contains a **text editor**, a **terminal** and a **directory browser** called ***Filetree***. These three tools are very useful for learning how to use the command line interface. If you are working on your computer it will be important to have these three tools open as well. Just bear in mind that some text editors (eg. Microsoft Word, Text Edit, Libre Office Writer) won't work since they introduce hidden characters. There are many good text editors available for Bioinformatics. Here is a list of some of the most common text editors.\n",

    "Now let's create a new file using the **file editor**. It is important to follow some rules when **naming your new file**. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should not use special characters such as `%`, `´`, `*`, `|`, `\\`, etc.\n",
    "2. Underscore `_` and dot `.` are allowed\n",
    "3. You should not use spaces. Instead of `My file` you can use `My_file` or `MyFile`\n",
    "\n",
    "The extension of a file won't interfere in the processing. If you have a text file you will be able to work with it in the command line if the extension is `.txt` or any other or even if there is no extension (`My_file.txt`, `My_file`, `My_file.hello`). However, it is a good practice to name a text file with the extension `.txt` in case you want to open it with a third party text editor. Also you will be able to recognize what kind of file you have just by looking at the extension. In Bioinformatics you will work with text files but in different biological formats. So it is important to add the extension of the corresponding biological format (eg. `.fasta`, `.gff3`, `.sam`, etc.).\n",

    "You don't have to save it as everything you type in will be saved automatically. In the *Filetree* section you will see your file. If you position the mouse in the three dots area you will find the options for **renaming**, **duplicating**, **downloading** or **deleting** your file.\n",
