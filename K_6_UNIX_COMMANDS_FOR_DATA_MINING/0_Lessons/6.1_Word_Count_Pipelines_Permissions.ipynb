    "The `wc`command which stands for *word count* counts **characters**, **words** and **lines**. \n",

    " 4  4 12 amounts.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "The numbers mean amount of **lines**, **words**, and **characters** respectively. Four lines, four words and ... wait! why do we get 12 characters if we can only see 8? This is because the **new line** is also a character üëÜ\n",
    "You can specify lines with `-l`, words with `-w` and characters with `-c`.\n",

    "## <p style=\"color:#2C6A7F\"> Pipelines `|`\n",
    "Many times you may want to use the output of a command as the input to another command. That is called a pipeline and we can do that with a **pipe** `|`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now print the lines that contain a letter `e` in the file `allfruits` in alphabetical order. So first you have to find the lines with `grep` and then sort them in alphabetical order with `sort`. *Remember that `allfruits` is in  the folder `Documents` so you have to either change directory or write the path to it.*\n",

    "The `|` will take the output of one command to the next command. But what if you just want to perform two different commands? For example, change directory and then look for a string inside a file. In this case you can use a **semicolon** `;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's find out how many characters contain the words that have a `p` in the file toygenes.txt that is in the folder `Practice`. So first you have to go to the folder `Practice`, then look for the letter `p` with `grep` and take the output into `cut` to select only the column that has the words, and then count the letters with `wc`. \n",

    "\n",

    "Indeed, the word `apple` contains  `5` characters and is the only word that contains a `p`. This will become very useful when we start mining biological data. \n",

    "## <p style=\"color:#2C6A7F\"> `chmod`\n",
    "\n",
    "In UNIX and UNIX-like systems all files and folders can have different permissions for the **user** [owner of the file]`u`, the **group** [specific users assigned by the administrator] `g` and **others** [anyone else] `o` and **all** [user, group and others]. This allows you to protect your files even from yourself.\n",
    "The different permissions are **reading** `r`, **writing** `w`, and **executing** `x`.\n",
    "To see the permissions of your files and folders in the `Documents` directory, change working directory `cd /root/sandbox/Documents` and then type `ls -l`\n",

    "\n",

    "The first position indicates if it is a **file** or a **directory**, the next three positions belong to the **user** [owner]. If she/he has reading, writing, and executing permissions you will see `rwx` if any of those permissions is not available it will be represented with a `-`. The three positions in the middle represent the permissions of the **group**, and the last three represent **others**, everyone else's permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to change permissions. One is through **characters** and the other one is through numbers, which is called the **octal** mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character mode\n",
    "In this mode  you can change permissions with symbols. Add `+`, remove `-`, specifies a permission `=`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `chmod +r myfile.txt`  adds **read** permissions to **all**\n",
    "* `chmod g-w myfile.txt`  removes **write** permissions to the **group**\n",
    "* `chmod u+x myfile.txt` adds **execute** permissions to the **user**\n",
    "* `chmod u=rw, go=  myfile.txt` adds **read & write** permissions to the **user** and removes **read, write & execute** permissions to the **group & others**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Octal mode\n",
    "In the octal mode each permissions combination is represented by a number\n",

    "\n",
    "* `chmod 777 myfile.txt` will give all permissions to everyone\n",
    "*  `chmod 766 myfile.txt` gives all permissions [read, write & execute] to the **user** and **read & write** to the **group & others**\n",
    "*  `chmod 635 myfile.txt` gives **read & write** permissions to the **user**, **write & execution** to the **group**, and **read and execution** to **othrers**.\n",
    "*  `chmod 444 myfile.txt` allows everyone to read the file but removes **write & execution** permissions. **This is very useful in bioinformatics to protect your raw data from unintended corruption, even from yourself.**\n",
