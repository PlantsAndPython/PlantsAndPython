    "We are studying some proteins that are involved in pathogenicity called effectors found on the sequences of the phytopathogen *Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis*. We want to know how many of those sequences are **RxLR** effectors (RxLR for containing Arginine, any amino acid, Leucine and Arginine). We also want to know which ones are cysteine-rich. And which of the RxLR effectors belong to a specific strain called Emoy2.\n",
