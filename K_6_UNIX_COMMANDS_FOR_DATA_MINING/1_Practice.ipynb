    "We are studying some proteins that are involved in pathogenicity called effectors found on the sequences of the phytopathogen *Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis*. We want to know how many of those sequences are **RxLR** effectors (RxLR for containing Arginine, any amino acid, Leucine and Arginine). We also want to know which ones are cysteine-rich. And which of the RxLR effectors belong to a specific strain called Emoy2. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, we are only going to look for the strings 'RxLR' and 'cysteine-rich' within the decription line. However, you could look for specific domains within the sequences using other tools to eliminate the line breaks and to look for ambiguous bases or amino acids. To convert the fasta file into a tabular file with each fasta record  in a single line, you can use this command `awk -v RS='\\n>' -v ORS='\\n>' -v OFS='' -F'\\n' '{$1=$1 \"\\t\"}1'  file.fasta`. Then you can select the second column and look for a string. You can use a dot `.` to find ambiguos bases or amino acids. The `.` is a regular expression that represents any character. So, instead of `RxLR`, if you look into the actual sequence, you would have to use `R.LR`. In order to search for regular expressions with `grep` you have to use the option `-E`. If you want to see the string colored in your search with `grep`, use the option `--color`.\n",
