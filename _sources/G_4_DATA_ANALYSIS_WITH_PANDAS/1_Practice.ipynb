    "After visiting Michigan and learning that wine grapes can be grown (and that wine can be made!) in such a cold place, you decide that you would like to start a vineyard there. You've seen the vineyards and know that, although it is possible to grow wine grapes there, that sometimes it is too cold. You wonder if because of climate change, Michigan might soon have a warmer, more suitable climate for growing grapes. \n",

    "You know that Europe has a long history of growing grapes, and you wonder if they kept records that might indicate how grapes respond to changes in temperature. You find a [study](https://www.clim-past.net/8/1403/2012/cp-8-1403-2012.pdf) that has compiled numerous records of grape harvest dates for more than four centuries and also a [database](http://www.climatemonitor.it/?page_id=40210&lang=en) of temperature anomalies in Europe dating back to 1655.\n",
