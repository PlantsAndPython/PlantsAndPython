    "You have already learn how to create a file with `cat > New_file`, however, `cat` is not a text editor. There are several text editors for the command line. The most common ones are `vi`, `vim` and `nano`. In your virtual terminal you have a text editor with a graphical interface. However, when you work remotely on a bioinformatics computer cluster for **High Performance Computing [HPC]** you may not be able to use any graphical interface software. So it is very important that you learn how to use **text editors in the command line**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## <p style=\"color:#2C6A7F\"> `vim` & `vi`\n",
    "The text editors `vim` and `vi` are very similar. We will learn the most important commands for `vim` and they will also work for `vi`. However, if you want to learn more options you can check the [vim documentation](https://vimhelp.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create file `vim Name_Of_File`\n",
    "* Edit file `i` which stands for *insert*\n",
